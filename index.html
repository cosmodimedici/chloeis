						<p>I’m a Brazilian graphic and web designer based in San Francisco, California. Currently working for Google, I am also the founder of Abduzeedo, a personal project that has become the biggest promoter of my work. Abduzeedo is now one of the design world’s most sought after blogs for design inspiration and tutorials.</p>
						<p>Over the years I have had the amazing honor to work on projects for web and print media as well for clients such as MSNBC, Wired UK, Adobe, Digital Arts Magazine and Abril among others.</p>
						
						<p>In 2011 I joined Google as senior designer at the Mountain View headquarters. For over 2 years I have had the opportunity to work on incredible projects, from Doodles and icons to major products like Google Wallet, Offers, Shopping, Currents, Ventures and others. Currently I am part of the Search/Knowledge team working with amazing people.</p>
